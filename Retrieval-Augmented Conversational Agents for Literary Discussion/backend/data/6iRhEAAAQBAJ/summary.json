His mother, Annemarie S\u00fcskind, n\u00e9e Schmitt, was a sports teacher; his older brother Martin Erhard S\u00fcskind (1944\u20132009) was a journalist and speechwriter.\nAfter his qualification testing for university and his mandatory community service, S\u00fcskind studied medieval and modern history at the University of Munich and in Aix-en-Provence from 1968 to 1974, but never graduated. Funded by his parents, he relocated to Paris, where he wrote \"mainly short, unpublished fiction and longer screenplays which were not made into films\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1981, he had his first major success with the play Der Kontraba\u00df (The Double Bass), which was conceived originally as a radio play. During the theatrical season of 1984\u201385, the play was performed more than 500 times. The only role is that of a tragi-comical orchestra musician. During the 1980s, working with the director Helmut Dietl, S\u00fcskind was also successful as a screenwriter for the television productions Monaco Franze (1983) and Kir Royal (1987), among others. In 1996 he won the Screenplay Prize of the German Department for Culture for his screenplay of Rossini, directed by Dietl. He rejected other awards, such as the FAZ-Literaturpreis, the Toucan Prize, and the Gutenberg Prize.\nHis best-known work is the novel Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (1985). Perfume was on the bestselling list of the German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel for nine years, has been translated into 49 languages and as of 2019 has worldwide sales of more than 20 million copies.
