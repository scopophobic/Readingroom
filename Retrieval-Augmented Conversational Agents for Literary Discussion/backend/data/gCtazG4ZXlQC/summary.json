The film is the first of two cinematic parts based on the 2007 novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J. K. Rowling. It is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) and the seventh instalment in the Harry Potter film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, respectively, reprising roles as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The story follows Harry Potter, who has been asked by Dumbledore to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to immortality \u2013 the Horcruxes.\nFilming began on 19 February 2009 and was completed on 12 June 2010.\nIt was released in 2D cinemas and IMAX formats in the United Kingdom and in the United States on 19 November 2010, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received positive reviews with critics praising the performances, cinematography, visual effects and musical score.\nIn the film's worldwide opening weekend, Part 1 grossed $330 million, the third-highest in the series, and the highest opening of 2010, as well as the eighth-highest of all time. With a worldwide gross of $960 million, Part 1 became the third-highest-grossing film of 2010, the tenth highest-grossing film of all time at the time  and the third-highest-grossing Harry Potter film in terms of worldwide totals. The film was nominated for many awards, including the Academy Award for Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects.\nThe film was followed by the concluding entry, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 in 2011.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt Malfoy Manor, Severus Snape meets with Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. He reports that the Order of the Phoenix will move Harry Potter, no longer under his mother's protective spell, to a safe location. Voldemort confiscates Lucius Malfoy's wand; his own is powerless against Harry because it and Harry's wand are \"brothers\" by sharing the same phoenix feather core. During the move, Harry and the Order are attacked by Voldemort and the Death Eaters, killing Hedwig and Mad-Eye Moody in the process.\nDuring preparations for Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, the new Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour arrives. He informs Harry, Ron, and Hermione that Albus Dumbledore left each a bequest: Ron a Deluminator, Hermione a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Harry the Golden Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match. Dumbledore also bequeathed the Sword of Gryffindor to Harry, but it has gone missing.\nNews arrives during the wedding that the Ministry has fallen and Scrimgeour is dead. Death Eaters attack, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape to Number 12, Grimmauld Place. While there, Ron realises that Sirius' brother, Regulus Black, is the R.A.B. who stole Salazar Slytherin's locket from Voldemort. Local thief Mundungus Fletcher later sold it to Dolores Umbridge. Harry, Ron, and Hermione infiltrate the Ministry and recover the locket, but Death Eaters chase them in a chaotic exit. Hermione disapparates them to a forest. Ron is injured. The trio starts their journey to discover and destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, beginning with the locket.\nAttempts to destroy the locket fail. Hermione deduces that Gryffindor's sword can destroy Horcruxes because it is impregnated with basilisk venom. Ron, affected by the dark locket, is frustrated with their slow progress and irrationally jealous of Harry and Hermione. He argues with Harry before leaving. When Harry touches the Snitch to his lips, it reveals a cryptic message: \"I open at the close.\" Hermione notices a strange symbol drawn in Beedle the Bard that is identical to one Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius wears.\nHarry and Hermione search for the sword in Godric's Hollow and encounter the same strange symbol in a cemetery. Elderly historian Bathilda Bagshot invites them in her cottage, where they find a photo of the young man in Harry's dream who stole a wand from wandmaker Gregorovitch. Bathilda morphs into Voldemort's snake Nagini and attacks Harry. Hermione disapparates them to safety, but her rebounding spell accidentally destroys Harry's wand. Hermione identifies the man in the photo as dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. That night, a doe patronus leads Harry to a frozen pond where Gryffindor's sword lies on the bottom. Harry dives into the frigid water, but the locket around his neck tightens, strangling him. Ron appears, retrieves the sword, and saves Harry. They destroy the locket Horcrux with the sword. Ron explains that the Deluminator led him to their location.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione visit Xenophilius Lovegood and learn the symbol represents the Deathly Hallows. Many years before, three brothers each received a prize that evades Death: the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility, and the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand known. Possessing all three makes one the Master of Death. Xenophilius secretly summons the Death Eaters, hoping to exchange Harry for a kidnapped Luna. The three escape, but Snatchers capture them. During a vision, Harry sees an elderly Grindelwald telling Voldemort that the Elder Wand is buried with Dumbledore.\nAt Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix Lestrange sees a Snatcher with Gryffindor's sword that she believed was in her Gringotts vault. Harry and Ron are locked into the cellar, where they encounter Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook. Upstairs, Bellatrix tortures Hermione. Harry begs for help using a mirror shard in which he believes he glimpsed Dumbledore; Dobby appears in response and helps save everyone while Harry grabs their captured wands from Draco Malfoy. As they disapparate, Bellatrix throws a knife, and Dobby is fatally wounded, dying in Harry's arms. Harry buries him near Bill and Fleur's seaside cottage, an Order safe house. Meanwhile, Voldemort retrieves the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nDaniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter: A 17-year-old wizard.\nRupert Grint as Ron Weasley: A young wizard and one of Harry's best friends and allies.\nEmma Watson as Hermione Granger: A young witch and one of Harry's best friends and Ron's love interest.\nRobbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid: Harry's half-giant friend, and gamekeeper at Hogwarts.\nWarwick Davis as Griphook: A goblin and former employee at Gringotts Bank.

Director David Yates, who shot the film alongside director of photography Eduardo Serra, described Part 1 as \"quite real\"; a \"road movie\" that's \"almost like a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary\".\nOriginally set for a single theatrical release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to what David Heyman called \"creative imperative\". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, \"No, David. How are we going to do it?\". After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.\nThe production filmed at the Dartford Crossing for the dramatic chase where Harry and Hagrid are being ambushed by Death Eaters.\n\n\n=== Sets ===\nStuart Craig, set designer for all of the previous Harry Potter films, returned for the final two parts. He said, \"We made a very different kind of film, which was shot a great deal on location. We travelled quite far, we built sets, and they spend a lot of time in a forest,\" he explained. \"We built forest sets and integrated them into the real forests, so there were challenges there, as you might imagine.\" Craig was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Part 1.\nOn the wedding tent for Bill and Fleur's wedding in Part 1, Craig commented on his aim to \"rather than make it an extension of the house, which is rather eccentric, homemade, we decided to make it rather elegant . . . It's lined with silk and beautiful, floating candelabra. So it's a nice contrast with the house.\" For the Ministry of Magic set, he noted, \"This is an underground world; this is a ministry, so we went to the real ministries, the Muggle ministries \u2013 Whitehall, in London \u2013 and decided that our magical ministry was kind of a parallel universe to these real ministries.\"\nCraig also commented on his design of Malfoy Manor, saying that it is \"a very strong architectural set. The exterior is based on an Elizabethan house here in this country called Hardwick Hall and it has massive windows, and these windows are kind of blinded out. The shutters are drawn so they are like blind windows and they have a real kind of presence, an ominous presence, so that gave us the basis for a good exterior. There's an extraordinary magical roof that's added and surrounded by forest which isn't there in reality, but again is one of the devices to make it more threatening and mysterious.\"\n\n\n=== Costumes ===\nThe costumes for Part 1 were designed by Jany Temime, who has been the costume designer on Harry Potter productions since Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). Temime was involved in a controversy regarding her work on Fleur Delacour's wedding dress. She was accused of copying the design from a similar dress from Alexander McQueen's Fall 2008 collection. Temime spoke about the dress, saying that she \"wanted it to be a witch wedding dress but not a Halloween dress. The dress is white but it needed to have something fantastic to it. So there is the phoenix [motif], the bird, which is a symbol of love in a way because there is rebirth, love never dies, it is born again.\"\n\n\n=== Visual effects ===\n\nAfter working on every film since Prisoner of Azkaban, Double Negative was asked to provide visual effects for the final instalments of the story, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Parts 1 and 2. Working closely with the film's VFX Supervisor, Tim Burke, the team was led by VFX Supervisor, David Vickery and VFX Producer Charlotte Loughlane. The main team also included 3D Supervisor, Rick Leary and 2D Supervisor, Sean Stranks.\nDouble Negative's work for Part 1 included the corroding Warner Brothers logo and extensive environment extensions of the Burrows and its surrounds. Additional environment work was completed on Xenophilius Lovegood's home, extending it in 3D and culminating in the Death Eaters' attack. Double Negative also advanced the Death Eaters' smoke effects, with the introduction of the 'flayed man' stage in between their smokey, fluid, flying state and their live-action presence upon landing. Other work included the Patronus charm that interrupts the wedding party to inform the guests that Voldemort has taken over the Ministry of Magic.\nThe visual-effects company Framestore produced most of the creature CGI, as in previous films, as well as the animated Tale of the Three Brothers sequence, which was directed and designed by Ben Hibon.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nComposer Nicholas Hooper, who scored Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince, did not return for Deathly Hallows. Instead, Alexandre Desplat was hired to compose the score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1. The film also featured the song \"O Children\" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe first official picture from the first film was released on 1 December 2009, showing Harry, Ron and Hermione in a London street. A clip was officially released on 8 December 2009 with the release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince on Blu-ray and DVD. At the 2010 ShoWest convention, Alan F. Horn premiered unfinished footage from both films. The 2010 MTV Movie Awards premiered more footage from Deathly Hallows. Following this was the release of the official teaser poster, which shows the release date of both Part 1 and Part 2 and a destroyed Hogwarts castle. ABC Family broadcast interviews and additional scenes from both parts during their Harry Potter weekend, which began on 8 July 2010. A two-minute trailer for the film was released worldwide on 22 September 2010.\nOn 29 September 2010, three character posters for Part 1 of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were released by Yahoo! Movies. The following day, a Part 1 cinema poster was released featuring the trio on the run in a forest. The theatrical poster has the tagline \"Nowhere is safe\", and another version with no credits has the tagline \"The end begins\". Various other character posters for Part 1 were released on 6 October 2010, featuring Harry, Ron, Hermione, Lord Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange, Severus Snape and Fenrir Greyback. On 12 October, four new character posters were released. The posters are set to the theme of \"Trust no one\" and \"The hunt begins\".\nOn 15 October 2010, tickets began selling on Fandango for the US release of Part 1, and on 19 October, a 50-second clip featuring never-before-seen footage was aired at the 2010 Scream Awards. On 16 October, the second TV spot was released on Cartoon Network during a premiere of Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster. On 25 October 2010, Yahoo! Movies released an exclusive featurette of the film. On 30 October 2010, Entertainment Weekly released two new featurettes titled \"Horcruxes\" and \"The Story\", featuring a large amount of never-before-seen footage. On the same day, the Warner Bros. Harry Potter website was updated to reveal twelve miniature clips from the film.\nOn 3 November 2010, the Los Angeles Times released an extended clip of Harry leaving the Burrow to find the Horcruxes, titled \"No One Else Is Going to Die for Me\". On 4 November, a new clip was released from the Harry Potter Facebook page, titled \"The Seven Potters\". Two more clips were released over the next two days, including a scene depicting a caf\u00e9 attack and another taking place in Malfoy Manor.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nOn 26 August 2010, director David Yates, producers David Heyman and David Barron, and with Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn attended a test screening for Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 in Chicago. The unfinished film gained rave reviews from test screeners, some of whom labelled it \"amazing and dark\" and \"the most perfect Harry Potter film\". Others expressed that the film faithfully adapted the novel, which led to an inheritance of the \"book's own problems\".\nWarner Bros. Pictures was originally going to release Part 1 of Deathly Hallows in 2D and 3D formats. On 8 October 2010, it was announced that plans for a 3D version of Part 1 had been scrapped. \"Warner Bros. Pictures has made the decision to release Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 in 2D, in both conventional and IMAX cinemas [because] we will not have a completed 3D version of the film within our release date window. Despite everyone's best efforts, we were unable to convert the film in its entirety and meet the highest standards of quality.\" Part 1 of Deathly Hallows was released on Blu-ray 3D as a Best Buy Exclusive. Part 2 was still released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX formats.\nThe world premiere for Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 was held in Leicester Square in London on 11 November 2010, with fans from across the world turning up \u2013 some of whom had camped for days in the square. This was followed by the Belgian premiere on 12 November and the US premiere in New York City on 15 November.\nJust 48 hours prior to the official North American launch of Part 1, the first 36 minutes of the film were leaked on the internet. Even before the leak, the film was already the fifth-biggest generator of advance ticket sales in history, after selling out 1,000 cinemas across the United States. Despite widely circulating rumours that the leaked footage was a marketing ploy to generate hype for the movie release date, no screener discs had been created by Warner Bros., and executives called it \"a serious breach of copyright violation and theft of Warner Bros. property\".\nIn Australia, the film had its premiere on 13 November at Warner Bros. Movie World, located on the Gold Coast, Queensland. Three hundred people attended the viewing, which was the second official showing in the world, behind the UK premiere. The film premiered in Kuwait on 16 November. In Israel, Estonia, and New Zealand, the film was released on 18 November.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 was released on a single and double disc DVD and 3-disc Blu-ray combo pack on 11 April 2011 in the UK and on 15 April 2011 in the US.\nOn 28 January 2011, it was announced by Emma Watson on the Harry Potter UK Facebook page that the page's fans will get to vote for their preferred cover for the Part 1 Blu-ray.

And those effects? They're so special you don't notice them.\" Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek gave a negative review, writing, \"They've taken one of the most enchanting series in contemporary fiction and sucked out all the magic . . . while Rowling's stories are endlessly inventive, Potter onscreen just gives you a headache.\"\nKeith Uhlich of Time Out New York named Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 the seventh-best film of 2010, calling it an \"elatingly downbeat blockbuster\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 was nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects at the 83rd Academy Awards.
